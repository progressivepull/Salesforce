**Create a Perspective to Generate and Analyze Logs**

Generate a debug log, and create a custom Perspective to analyze it.

* For the SFDC_DevConsole debug level, set the logging level for ApexCode to **FINEST**
* Use the Execute Anonymous window to execute the **EmailMissionSpecialist** Apex class that you created earlier, providing your own email address
* Create a Developer Console Perspective:
    - Panels:
        - Stack Tree
        - Execution Stack
        - Execution Log
        - Source
        - Execution Overview
    - Name: **Execution Details**
