# ✅ 1. What are the three parts of the command structure?

**Correct Answer: D – Command, Flag, Arguments**

* A typical CLI command consists of:

    - The command (what you want to do)

    - One or more flags (options that modify behavior, often prefixed with - or --)

    -  Arguments (targets or values passed into the command)

Example:

``` bash
ls -l /home/user
```

* ls = command

* -l = flag

* /home/user = argument
