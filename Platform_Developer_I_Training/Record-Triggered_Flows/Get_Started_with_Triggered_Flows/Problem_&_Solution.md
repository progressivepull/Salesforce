# Problems & Solution

# 1 If you want to automate a process to run every time a contact is added to an account, which type of flow is best suited to the task?

* A Screen Flow
* B Autolaunched Flow
* C Triggered Flow
* D Advanced Flow

## ANSWER

Correct Answer: C Triggered Flow

A Triggered Flow runs automatically in response to record changes, such as creating or updating a Contact.

Perfect for background automation without user interaction.

A Screen Flow would require user input, which isn’t ideal for seamless automation.

# 2 Which record-triggered flow option would you use to send a subscription renewal offer one month before the current subscription expires?

* A Fast Field Update
* B Related Records and Actions
* C Run Asynchronously
* D Scheduled Paths

## ANSWER

Correct Answer: D Scheduled Paths

Scheduled Paths let you delay actions relative to a date field or time trigger—ideal for your “1-month-before-expiry” scenario.

Fast Field Update is for quick updates on the same record.

Run Asynchronously handles longer processes or external calls.

Related Records and Actions apply changes to related records but don't help with timing.
