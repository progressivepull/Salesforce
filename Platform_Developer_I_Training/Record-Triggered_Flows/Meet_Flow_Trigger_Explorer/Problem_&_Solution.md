## ANSWER

What tool do you use to see the scheduled paths that run in the future?

# Correct Answer: C Time-Based Workflow page

* This page lets you view scheduled actions like those set to occur days after a record update or close.
* Perfect for tracking delayed or time-dependent flow executions.
* Flow Trigger Explorer shows triggers but not the timing or future paths.
* Orchestration Runs List is used for Flow Orchestration tracking, which isn’t applicable here.
* Flow Builder designs flows, but doesn’t list future scheduled runs.

* A True
* B False
