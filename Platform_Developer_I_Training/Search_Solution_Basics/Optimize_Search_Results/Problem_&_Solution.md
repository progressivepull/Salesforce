## ANSWER

# Correct Answer: A Limit what you're searching through and limit the number of results.

* Efficient text searches are achieved by narrowing the scope of the search (e.g., specific objects or fields) and limiting the number of results returned. This reduces processing time and improves performance.

* Other options, like shortening the search string or only searching the name field, are not comprehensive solutions for efficiency.

* A Host webinars for users on best search practices.
* B Rename records.
* C Set up synonym groups and promoted search terms.
* D Nothing. You're all alone in your quest to improve search solutions.

## ANSWER

# Correct Answer: C Set up synonym groups and promoted search terms.

* Admins can configure synonym groups to improve search relevance and promote specific search terms to prioritize certain results.

* Other options, like renaming records or hosting webinars, do not directly influence search rankings.
