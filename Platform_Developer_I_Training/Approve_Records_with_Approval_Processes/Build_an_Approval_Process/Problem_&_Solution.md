Salesforce approval process: an overview
The Salesforce Approval Process is an automated system for managing record approval workflows within your organization. It ensures that records meet predefined criteria and are reviewed and approved by the appropriate personnel before any further actions are taken.

## Key elements of a Salesforce Approval Process
* **Approval Steps:** These define the sequential stages records go through for approval. Each step can have its own criteria and assigned approvers.
* **Approvers:** These are the individuals or groups responsible for reviewing and making decisions on approval requests. Approvers can be assigned based on various factors, such as hierarchy, roles, or queues.
* **Entry Criteria:** Conditions a record must meet to initiate the approval process.
* **Actions:** Automated tasks that occur at different stages of the approval process. These include:

- **Initial Submission Actions:** Actions triggered when a record is first submitted for approval, like locking the record or sending notifications.
- **Approval Actions:** Actions triggered when a record is approved at a particular step, such as updating fields or creating tasks.
- **Rejection Actions:** Actions triggered when an approver rejects a request, like sending notifications or updating statuses.
- **Recall Actions:** Actions triggered when the submitter decides to withdraw the request before approval.

**Create an approval process**

Create an approval process to ensure that prospect accounts with more than 500 employees are approved before they‚Äôre converted to customers

**Before You Start**

Go to Object Manager. In Fields and Relationships for the Account object, check the Type field‚Äôs picklist values for **Prospect, Customer, and Pending**. Add any of these values that are missing.
